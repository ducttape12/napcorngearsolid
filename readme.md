# Napcorn Gear Solid
This is an old program I wrote in high school for my C++ programming class.  The setting is an inside joke.  The code is unspeakably bad and probably doesn't even compile on modern systems.

Anyway, here's what I wrote to describe the program:

# Purpose
This program is a parody of the popular Komani game, Metal Gear Solid.  The user plays a Morris Chestnut, going through many rooms trying to find the Napcorn Horde.  Controls are as follows:

```
         I = Up
J = Left        L = Right
        K = Down
```

More information on the game is detailed in functions.

This game made possible by Nap Co. and Napcorn Industries of America.
